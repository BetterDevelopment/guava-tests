# Guava test samples #
This workspace consists unit tests for guava libraries. Tests are categorized in different directories, one for each library.

The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth.
If you want to learn guava libraries the best way is writing test samples for it. If you've never used Guava before check https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki.

Help us improve this set of tests :).
